# 🛰️ Drone Swarm Command UI  
**Airan Defense Technology Philippines**

A prototype **drone swarm command software interface** designed for combat drone operations with ethical targeting, real-time radar visualization, and autonomous behavior simulation.

> 🎯 For demonstration, academic recognition (ETEEAP), and government tech evaluation (DOST/AFP).

## 🔧 Built With
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Dark military dashboard theme)  
- JavaScript (Canvas Radar + Target Lock Logic)  
- GitHub Pages (Live demo hosting)
